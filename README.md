# kotlin-url-gen
A url and transformation generator for Kotlin

#### ** NOTE: This is a very early stage work-in-progress library.** 

The purpose of the library is to generate Cloudinary assets delivery urls in Kotlin.
This library supports the full set of Cloudinary's delivery configurations as well as the majority of video and image
transformations.

#### Configuration
At the moment this library is only available directly from the source code in this repository.
Once the library reaches a more stable status it'll be distributed through maven.

#### Usage
Each request for building a URL of a remote cloud resource must have the `cloud_name` parameter set. 
Setting the `cloud_name` parameter can be done either when initializing the library, or by using the CLOUDINARY_URL 
environment variable.

The entry point of the library is the `Cloudinary` object. Once an instance is created a url can be generated by calling 
it's `url` method.

For example, this code create a url for an image called `sample` on the `demo` account, converting the image to the
 `webp` format
A transformation is also added to the image - cropping and using the sepia effect:

```kotlin
 val cloudinary = Cloudinary("cloudinary://@demo")
 val transformation = Transformation().resize(crop(350, height = 200, gravity = auto())).effect(sepia(50))
 val url = cloudinary.url(format = "webp", transformation = transformation, publicId = "sample")
 println(url.generate())
```

This will output the following url:
`https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_crop,g_auto,h_200,w_350/e_sepia:50/sample.webp`
